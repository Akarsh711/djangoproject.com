In\nparticular:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><strong>Do</strong> read the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../../faq/\"><span class=\"doc\">FAQ</span></a> to see if your issue might\nbe a well-known question.</li>\n<li><strong>Do</strong> ask on <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../mailing-lists/#django-users-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-users</span></a> or <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://web.libera.chat/#django\">#django</a> <em>first</em> if you\u2019re not sure if\nwhat you\u2019re seeing is a bug.</li>\n<li><strong>Do</strong> write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. You must\ninclude a clear, concise description of the problem, and a set of\ninstructions for replicating it. Add as much debug information as you can:\ncode snippets, test cases, exception backtraces, screenshots, etc. A nice\nsmall test case is the best way to report a bug, as it gives us a\nhelpful way to confirm the bug quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t</strong> post to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> only to announce that you have filed a\nbug report.

Here are some tips on how to make a request most effectively:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Make sure the feature actually requires changes in Django\u2019s core. If your\nidea can be developed as an independent application or module \u2014 for\ninstance, you want to support another database engine \u2014 we\u2019ll probably\nsuggest that you develop it independently. Then, if your project gathers\nsufficient community support, we may consider it for inclusion in Django.</li>\n<li>First request the feature on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://forum.djangoproject.com/\">Django Forum</a> or <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> list,\nnot in the ticket tracker. It\u2019ll get read more closely if it\u2019s on the mailing\nlist. This is even more important for large-scale feature requests. We like\nto discuss any big changes to Django\u2019s core before actually working on them.</li>\n<li>Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is and how you\u2019d\nlike to see it implemented. Include example code (non-functional is OK)\nif possible.</li>\n<li>Explain <em>why</em> you\u2019d like the feature. Explaining a minimal use case will help\nothers understand where it fits in, and if there are already other ways of\nachieving the same thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there\u2019s a consensus agreement on the feature, then it\u2019s appropriate to\ncreate a ticket. Include a link to the discussion in the ticket description.</p>\n<p>As with most open-source projects, code talks. If you are willing to write the\ncode for the feature yourself or, even better, if you\u2019ve already written it,\nit\u2019s much more likely to be accepted. Fork Django on GitHub, create a feature\nbranch, and show us your work!</p>\n<p>See also: <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../writing-documentation/#documenting-new-features\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Documenting new features</span></a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-how-we-make-decisions\">\n<span id=\"s-id2\"></span><span id=\"how-we-make-decisions\"></span><span id=\"id2\"></span><h2>How we make decisions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-we-make-decisions\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Whenever possible, we strive for a rough consensus. To that end, we\u2019ll often\nhave informal votes on <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> or the Django Forum about a feature.\nIn these votes we follow the voting style invented by Apache and used on Python\nitself, where votes are given as +1, +0, -0, or -1.\nRoughly translated, these votes mean:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>+1: \u201cI love the idea and I\u2019m strongly committed to it.\u201d</li>\n<li>+0: \u201cSounds OK to me.\u201d</li>\n<li>-0: \u201cI\u2019m not thrilled, but I won\u2019t stand in the way.\u201d</li>\n<li>-1: \u201cI strongly disagree and would be very unhappy to see the idea turn\ninto reality.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although these votes are informal, they\u2019ll be taken very seriously. After a\nsuitable voting period, if an obvious consensus arises we\u2019ll follow the votes.</p>\n<p>However, consensus is not always possible. If consensus cannot be reached, or\nif the discussion toward a consensus fizzles out without a concrete decision,\nthe decision may be deferred to the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../organization/#steering-council\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">steering council</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Internally, the steering council will use the same voting mechanism. A\nproposition will be considered carried if:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>There are at least three \u201c+1\u201d votes from members of the steering council.</li>\n<li>There is no \u201c-1\u201d vote from any member of the steering council.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Votes should be submitted within a week.</p>\n<p>Since this process allows any steering council member to veto a proposal, a\n\u201c-1\u201d vote should be accompanied by an explanation of what it would take to\nconvert that \u201c-1\u201d into at least a \u201c+0\u201d.</p>\n<p>Votes on technical matters should be announced and held in public on the\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> mailing list or on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://forum.djangoproject.com/\">Django Forum</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "metatags": "", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["py-modindex", "Python Module Index", "", "modules"], ["internals/contributing/triaging-tickets", "Triaging tickets", "N", "next"], ["internals/contributing/new-contributors", "Advice for new contributors", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "internals/contributing/bugs-and-features.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Reporting bugs and requesting features</a><ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#reporting-bugs\">Reporting bugs</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#reporting-user-interface-bugs-and-features\">Reporting user interface bugs and features</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#requesting-features\">Requesting features</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#how-we-make-decisions\">How we make decisions</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "display_toc": true, "page_source_suffix": ".txt", "current_page_name": "internals/contributing/bugs-and-features", "sidebars": ["localtoc.html", "relations.html", "sourcelink.html", "searchbox.html"], "customsidebar": null, "favicon_url": null, "logo_url": null, "alabaster_version": "0.7.13", "include_console_assets": false}
