The details of every change in this release would be\ntoo extensive to list in full, but a summary is presented below.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-suitability-and-api-stability\">\n<span id=\"suitability-and-api-stability\"></span><h2>Suitability and API stability<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#suitability-and-api-stability\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>This release is intended to provide a stable reference point for developers\nwanting to work on production-level applications that use Django.</p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s not the 1.0 release, and we\u2019ll be introducing further changes\nbefore 1.0. For a clear look at which areas of the framework will change (and\nwhich ones will <em>not</em> change) before 1.0, see the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">api-stability.txt</span></code> file,\nwhich lives in the docs/ directory of the distribution.</p>\n<p>You may have a need to use some of the features that are marked as\n\u201csubject to API change\u201d in that document, but that\u2019s OK with us as long as it\u2019s\nOK with you, and as long as you understand APIs may change in the future.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, most of Django\u2019s core APIs won\u2019t be changing before version 1.0.\nThere likely won\u2019t be as big of a change between 0.95 and 1.0 versions as there\nwas between 0.91 and 0.95.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-changes-and-new-features\">\n<span id=\"changes-and-new-features\"></span><h2>Changes and new features<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#changes-and-new-features\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The major changes in this release (for developers currently using the 0.91\nrelease) are a result of merging the \u2018magic-removal\u2019 branch of development.\nThis branch removed a number of constraints in the way Django code had to be\nwritten that were a consequence of decisions made in the early days of Django,\nprior to its open-source release. It\u2019s now possible to write more natural,\nPythonic code that works as expected, and there\u2019s less \u201cblack magic\u201d happening\nbehind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, another main theme of this release is a dramatic increase in\nusability. We\u2019ve made countless improvements in error messages, documentation,\netc., to improve developers\u2019 quality of life.</p>\n<p>The new features and changes introduced in 0.95 include:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Django now uses a more consistent and natural filtering interface for\nretrieving objects from the database.</li>\n<li>User-defined models, functions and constants now appear in the module\nnamespace they were defined in. (Previously everything was magically\ntransferred to the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">django.models.*</span></code> namespace.)</li>\n<li>Some optional applications, such as the FlatPage, Sites and Redirects\napps, have been decoupled and moved into <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">django.contrib</span></code>. If you don\u2019t\nwant to use these applications, you no longer have to install their\ndatabase tables.</li>\n<li>Django now has support for managing database transactions.</li>\n<li>We\u2019ve added the ability to write custom authentication and authorization\nbackends for authenticating users against alternate systems, such as\nLDAP.</li>\n<li>We\u2019ve made it easier to add custom table-level functions to models,\nthrough a new \u201cManager\u201d API.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s now possible to use Django without a database. This simply means\nthat the framework no longer requires you to have a working database set\nup just to serve dynamic pages. In other words, you can just use\nURLconfs/views on their own. Previously, the framework required that a\ndatabase be configured, regardless of whether you actually used it.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s now more explicit and natural to override <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">save()</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">delete()</span></code>\nmethods on models, rather than needing to hook into the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pre_save()</span></code> and\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">post_save()</span></code> method hooks.</li>\n<li>Individual pieces of the framework now can be configured without\nrequiring the setting of an environment variable. This permits use of,\nfor example, the Django templating system inside other applications.</li>\n<li>More and more parts of the framework have been internationalized, as\nwe\u2019ve expanded internationalization (i18n) support. The Django\ncodebase, including code and templates, has now been translated, at least\nin part, into 31 languages. From Arabic to Chinese to Hungarian to Welsh,\nit is now possible to use Django\u2019s admin site in your native language.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of changes required to port from 0.91-compatible code to the 0.95\ncode base are significant in some cases. However, they are, for the most part,\nreasonably routine and only need to be done once. A list of the necessary\nchanges is described in the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/RemovingTheMagic\">Removing The Magic</a> wiki page. There is also an\neasy <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/MagicRemovalCheatSheet\">checklist</a> for reference when undertaking the porting operation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-problem-reports-and-getting-help\">\n<span id=\"problem-reports-and-getting-help\"></span><h2>Problem reports and getting help<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#problem-reports-and-getting-help\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Need help resolving a problem with Django?
