We\u2019ve written an entire document devoted to this question.\nIt\u2019s titled <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../internals/contributing/\"><span class=\"doc\">Contributing to Django</span></a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-i-submitted-a-bug-fix-in-the-ticket-system-several-weeks-ago-why-are-you-ignoring-my-patch\">\n<span id=\"i-submitted-a-bug-fix-in-the-ticket-system-several-weeks-ago-why-are-you-ignoring-my-patch\"></span><h2>I submitted a bug fix in the ticket system several weeks ago. Why are you ignoring my patch?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#i-submitted-a-bug-fix-in-the-ticket-system-several-weeks-ago-why-are-you-ignoring-my-patch\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry: We\u2019re not ignoring you!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand there is a difference between \u201ca ticket is being\nignored\u201d and \u201ca ticket has not been attended to yet.\u201d Django\u2019s ticket system\ncontains hundreds of open tickets, of various degrees of impact on end-user\nfunctionality, and Django\u2019s developers have to review and prioritize.</p>\n<p>On top of that: the people who work on Django are all volunteers. As a result,\nthe amount of time that we have to work on the framework is limited and will\nvary from week to week depending on our spare time. If we\u2019re busy, we may not\nbe able to spend as much time on Django as we might want.</p>\n<p>The best way to make sure tickets do not get hung up on the way to checkin is\nto make it dead easy, even for someone who may not be intimately familiar with\nthat area of the code, to understand the problem and verify the fix:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Are there clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug? If this\ntouches a dependency (such as Pillow), a contrib module, or a specific\ndatabase, are those instructions clear enough even for someone not\nfamiliar with it?</li>\n<li>If there are several patches attached to the ticket, is it clear what\neach one does, which ones can be ignored and which matter?</li>\n<li>Does the patch include a unit test? If not, is there a very clear\nexplanation why not? A test expresses succinctly what the problem is,\nand shows that the patch actually fixes it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your patch stands no chance of inclusion in Django, we won\u2019t ignore it \u2013\nwe\u2019ll just close the ticket. So if your ticket is still open, it doesn\u2019t mean\nwe\u2019re ignoring you; it just means we haven\u2019t had time to look at it yet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-when-and-how-might-i-remind-the-team-of-a-patch-i-care-about\">\n<span id=\"when-and-how-might-i-remind-the-team-of-a-patch-i-care-about\"></span><h2>When and how might I remind the team of a patch I care about?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#when-and-how-might-i-remind-the-team-of-a-patch-i-care-about\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>A polite, well-timed message to the mailing list is one way to get attention.\nTo determine the right time, you need to keep an eye on the schedule. If you\npost your message right before a release deadline, you\u2019re not likely to get the\nsort of attention you require.</p>\n<p>Gentle IRC reminders can also work \u2013 again, strategically timed if possible.\nDuring a bug sprint would be a very good time, for example.</p>\n<p>Another way to get traction is to pull several related tickets together. When\nsomeone sits down to review a bug in an area they haven\u2019t touched for\na while, it can take a few minutes to remember all the fine details of how\nthat area of code works. If you collect several minor bug fixes together into\na similarly themed group, you make an attractive target, as the cost of coming\nup to speed on an area of code can be spread over multiple tickets.</p>\n<p>Please refrain from emailing anyone personally or repeatedly raising the same\nissue over and over again. This sort of behavior will not gain you any\nadditional attention \u2013 certainly not the attention that you need in order to\nget your issue addressed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-but-i-ve-reminded-you-several-times-and-you-keep-ignoring-my-patch\">\n<span id=\"but-i-ve-reminded-you-several-times-and-you-keep-ignoring-my-patch\"></span><h2>But I\u2019ve reminded you several times and you keep ignoring my patch!<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#but-i-ve-reminded-you-several-times-and-you-keep-ignoring-my-patch\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Seriously - we\u2019re not ignoring you. If your patch stands no chance of\ninclusion in Django, we\u2019ll close the ticket. For all the other tickets, we\nneed to prioritize our efforts, which means that some tickets will be\naddressed before others.</p>\n<p>One of the criteria that is used to prioritize bug fixes is the number of\npeople that will likely be affected by a given bug. Bugs that have the\npotential to affect many people will generally get priority over those that\nare edge cases.</p>\n<p>Another reason that a bug might be ignored for a while is if the bug is a\nsymptom of a larger problem. While we can spend time writing, testing and\napplying lots of little patches, sometimes the right solution is to rebuild. If\na rebuild or refactor of a particular component has been proposed or is\nunderway, you may find that bugs affecting that component will not get as much\nattention. Again, this is a matter of prioritizing scarce resources. By\nconcentrating on the rebuild, we can close all the little bugs at once, and\nhopefully prevent other little bugs from appearing in the future.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular\nbug regularly, it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that every single Django user\nwill hit the same bug. Different users use Django in different ways, stressing\ndifferent parts of the code under different conditions. When we evaluate the\nrelative priorities, we are generally trying to consider the needs of the\nentire community, instead of prioritizing the impact on one particular user.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we think your problem is unimportant \u2013 just that in the\nlimited time we have available, we will always err on the side of making 10\npeople happy rather than making a single person happy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-i-m-sure-my-ticket-is-absolutely-100-perfect-can-i-mark-it-as-ready-for-checkin-myself\">\n<span id=\"i-m-sure-my-ticket-is-absolutely-100-perfect-can-i-mark-it-as-ready-for-checkin-myself\"></span><h2>I\u2019m sure my ticket is absolutely 100% perfect, can I mark it as \u201cReady For Checkin\u201d myself?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#i-m-sure-my-ticket-is-absolutely-100-perfect-can-i-mark-it-as-ready-for-checkin-myself\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Sorry, no.
