All other persons who believe\nthemselves eligible to vote, but who have not yet registered to vote, may\nmake an application to the DSF Board for voting privileges. The voter\nregistration form and roll of voters is maintained by the DSF Board. The DSF\nBoard may challenge and reject the registration of voters it believes are\nregistering in bad faith or who it believes have falsified their\nqualifications or are otherwise unqualified.</li>\n<li>Registration of voters close one week after the announcement of the\nelection.

The candidate registration form and\nroster of candidates are maintained by the DSF Board, and candidates must\nprovide evidence of their qualifications as part of registration. The DSF\nBoard may challenge and reject the registration of candidates it believes do\nnot meet the qualifications of members of the Steering Council, or who it\nbelieves are registering in bad faith.</li>\n<li>Registration of candidates close one week after it has opened. One week\nafter registration of candidates closes, the Secretary of the DSF publish\nthe roster of candidates to the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> mailing list and the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://forum.djangoproject.com/\">Django forum</a>, and the election begin.

Each\nvoter may vote for up to five candidates on the ballot.</li>\n<li>The election conclude one week after it begins. The DSF Board then tally the\nvotes and produce a summary, including the total number of votes cast and\nthe number received by each candidate. This summary is ratified by a\nmajority vote of the DSF Board, then posted by the Secretary of the DSF to\nthe <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-developers</span></a> mailing list and the Django Forum.
