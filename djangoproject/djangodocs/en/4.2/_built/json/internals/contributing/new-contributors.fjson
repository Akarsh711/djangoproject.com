If you\ncan reproduce it and it seems valid, make a note that you confirmed the bug\nand accept the ticket. Make sure the ticket is filed under the correct\ncomponent area. Consider writing a patch that adds a test for the bug\u2019s\nbehavior, even if you don\u2019t fix the bug itself. See more at\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../triaging-tickets/#how-can-i-help-with-triaging\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">How can I help with triaging?</span></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Look for tickets that are accepted and review patches to build familiarity\nwith the codebase and the process</strong></p>\n<p>Mark the appropriate flags if a patch needs docs or tests. Look through the\nchanges a patch makes, and keep an eye out for syntax that is incompatible\nwith older but still supported versions of Python. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../writing-code/unit-tests/\"><span class=\"doc\">Run the tests</span></a> and make sure they pass.\nWhere possible and relevant, try them out on a database other than SQLite.\nLeave comments and feedback!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Keep old patches up to date</strong></p>\n<p>Oftentimes the codebase will change between a patch being submitted and the\ntime it gets reviewed. Make sure it still applies cleanly and functions as\nexpected. Updating a patch is both useful and important! See more on\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../writing-code/submitting-patches/\"><span class=\"doc\">Submitting patches</span></a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Write some documentation</strong></p>\n<p>Django\u2019s documentation is great but it can always be improved. Did you find\na typo? Do you think that something should be clarified? Go ahead and\nsuggest a documentation patch!

If your\ncontribution is more than one or two lines of code, you need to sign the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/\">CLA</a>. See the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/\">Contributor License Agreement FAQ</a> for a more thorough\nexplanation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-guidelines\">\n<span id=\"guidelines\"></span><h2>Guidelines<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#guidelines\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>As a newcomer on a large project, it\u2019s easy to experience frustration. Here\u2019s\nsome advice to make your work on Django more useful and rewarding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Pick a subject area that you care about, that you are familiar with, or\nthat you want to learn about</strong></p>\n<p>You don\u2019t already have to be an expert on the area you want to work on; you\nbecome an expert through your ongoing contributions to the code.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Analyze tickets\u2019 context and history</strong></p>\n<p>Trac isn\u2019t an absolute; the context is just as important as the words.\nWhen reading Trac, you need to take into account who says things, and when\nthey were said. Support for an idea two years ago doesn\u2019t necessarily mean\nthat the idea will still have support. You also need to pay attention to who\n<em>hasn\u2019t</em> spoken \u2013 for example, if an experienced contributor hasn\u2019t been\nrecently involved in a discussion, then a ticket may not have the support\nrequired to get into Django.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Start small</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to get feedback on a little issue than on a big one. See the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&amp;easy=1\">easy pickings</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>If you\u2019re going to engage in a big task, make sure that your idea has\nsupport first</strong></p>\n<p>This means getting someone else to confirm that a bug is real before you fix\nthe issue, and ensuring that there\u2019s consensus on a proposed feature before\nyou go implementing it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Be bold! Leave feedback!</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes it can be scary to put your opinion out to the world and say \u201cthis\nticket is correct\u201d or \u201cthis patch needs work\u201d, but it\u2019s the only way the\nproject moves forward. The contributions of the broad Django community\nultimately have a much greater impact than that of any one person. We can\u2019t\ndo it without <strong>you</strong>!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Err on the side of caution when marking things Ready For Check-in</strong></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re really not certain if a ticket is ready, don\u2019t mark it as\nsuch. Leave a comment instead, letting others know your thoughts.  If you\u2019re\nmostly certain, but not completely certain, you might also try asking on IRC\nto see if someone else can confirm your suspicions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Wait for feedback, and respond to feedback that you receive</strong></p>\n<p>Focus on one or two tickets, see them through from start to finish, and\nrepeat. The shotgun approach of taking on lots of tickets and letting some\nfall by the wayside ends up doing more harm than good.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Be rigorous</strong></p>\n<p>When we say \u201c<span class=\"target\" id=\"index-0\"></span><a class=\"pep reference external\" href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/\"><strong>PEP 8</strong></a>, and must have docs and tests\u201d, we mean it. If a patch\ndoesn\u2019t have docs and tests, there had better be a good reason. Arguments\nlike \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any existing tests of this feature\u201d don\u2019t carry much\nweight\u2013while it may be true, that means you have the extra-important job of\nwriting the very first tests for that feature, not that you get a pass from\nwriting tests altogether.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p class=\"first\"><strong>Be patient</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s not always easy for your ticket or your patch to be reviewed quickly.\nThis isn\u2019t personal. There are a lot of tickets and pull requests to get\nthrough.</p>\n<p>Keeping your patch up to date is important. Review the ticket on Trac to\nensure that the <em>Needs tests</em>, <em>Needs documentation</em>, and <em>Patch needs\nimprovement</em> flags are unchecked once you\u2019ve addressed all review comments.</p>\n<p>Remember that Django has an eight-month release cycle, so there\u2019s plenty of\ntime for your patch to be reviewed.</p>\n<p>Finally, a well-timed reminder can help.
