This is to\naid organizations that need to ensure they have staff available to handle\ntriaging our announcement and upgrade Django as needed. Severity levels are:</p>\n<p><strong>High</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Remote code execution</li>\n<li>SQL injection</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Moderate</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Cross site scripting (XSS)</li>\n<li>Cross site request forgery (CSRF)</li>\n<li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>\n<li>Broken authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Low</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Sensitive data exposure</li>\n<li>Broken session management</li>\n<li>Unvalidated redirects/forwards</li>\n<li>Issues requiring an uncommon configuration option</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second, we notify a list of <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#security-notifications\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">people and organizations</span></a>, primarily composed of operating-system vendors and\nother distributors of Django. This email is signed with the PGP key of someone\nfrom <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#releasers-team\">Django\u2019s release team</a> and consists of:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>A full description of the issue and the affected versions of Django.</li>\n<li>The steps we will be taking to remedy the issue.</li>\n<li>The patch(es), if any, that will be applied to Django.</li>\n<li>The date on which the Django team will apply these patches, issue\nnew releases and publicly disclose the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the day of disclosure, we will take the following steps:</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic simple\">\n<li>Apply the relevant patch(es) to Django\u2019s codebase.</li>\n<li>Issue the relevant release(s), by placing new packages on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Django/\">Python\nPackage Index</a> and on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/download/\">djangoproject.com website</a>, and tagging the new release(s)\nin Django\u2019s git repository.</li>\n<li>Post a public entry on <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/\">the official Django development blog</a>,\ndescribing the issue and its resolution in detail, pointing to the\nrelevant patches and new releases, and crediting the reporter of\nthe issue (if the reporter wishes to be publicly identified).</li>\n<li>Post a notice to the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../mailing-lists/#django-announce-mailing-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">django-announce</span></a> and <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"mailto:oss-security&#37;&#52;&#48;lists&#46;openwall&#46;com\">oss-security<span>&#64;</span>lists<span>&#46;</span>openwall<span>&#46;</span>com</a>\nmailing lists that links to the blog post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a reported issue is believed to be particularly time-sensitive \u2013\ndue to a known exploit in the wild, for example \u2013 the time between\nadvance notification and public disclosure may be shortened\nconsiderably.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if we have reason to believe that an issue reported to\nus affects other frameworks or tools in the Python/web ecosystem, we\nmay privately contact and discuss those issues with the appropriate\nmaintainers, and coordinate our own disclosure and resolution with\ntheirs.</p>\n<p>The Django team also maintains an <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../releases/security/\"><span class=\"doc\">archive of security issues\ndisclosed in Django</span></a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-who-receives-advance-notification\">\n<span id=\"s-security-notifications\"></span><span id=\"who-receives-advance-notification\"></span><span id=\"security-notifications\"></span><h2>Who receives advance notification<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#who-receives-advance-notification\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The full list of people and organizations who receive advance\nnotification of security issues is not and will not be made public.</p>\n<p>We also aim to keep this list as small as effectively possible, in\norder to better manage the flow of confidential information prior to\ndisclosure.

In either case,\nsuch addresses <strong>must not</strong> forward to public mailing lists or bug\ntrackers. Addresses which forward to the private email of an\nindividual maintainer or security-response contact are acceptable,\nalthough private security trackers or security-response groups are\nstrongly preferred.</li>\n<li>On a case-by-case basis, individual package maintainers who have\ndemonstrated a commitment to responding to and responsibly acting\non these notifications.</li>\n<li>On a case-by-case basis, other entities who, in the judgment of the\nDjango development team, need to be made aware of a pending\nsecurity issue. Typically, membership in this group will consist of\nsome of the largest and/or most likely to be severely impacted\nknown users or distributors of Django, and will require a\ndemonstrated ability to responsibly receive, keep confidential and\nact on these notifications.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"admonition-security-audit-and-scanning-entities admonition\">\n<p class=\"first admonition-title\">Security audit and scanning entities</p>\n<p class=\"last\">As a policy, we do not add these types of entities to the notification\nlist.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"s-requesting-notifications\">\n<span id=\"requesting-notifications\"></span><h2>Requesting notifications<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#requesting-notifications\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>If you believe that you, or an organization you are authorized to\nrepresent, fall into one of the groups listed above, you can ask to be\nadded to Django\u2019s notification list by emailing\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">security&#64;djangoproject.com</span></code>.
